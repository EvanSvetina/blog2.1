<br><p>During the creation of this blog, approximately... 0 things went smoothly. Overcoming many of these challenges felt weird at first - after all, I barely knew what I was doing at any given moment, and I felt quite lost in the sea of commands and variables that I didnt know the meaning of. However, with frequent help from outside sources, I managed to get the ground work done. Once I finally got my footing and began to try and understand everything I did, my perspective shifted.<br>
<br>
I slowly picked up new minor skills and figured out how to logic the blog, using heavy duty tools like ChatGPT when needed for help with syntax. I wanted to, as much as possible, avoid using ChatGPT to make logic for me because I wanted to try and solve my problems on my own or with my partner.<br>
<br>
This initial breakthrough has helped me create this silly little blog, and I'm excited for the future I have in this class!</p>

<h1>CS PANEL</h1>
<p><br>Stuff I learned/Notes to self:
<ul>
    <li>The main appeal of CS: Project-based EVERYTHING. If you understand how your code works, even if it doesn't work yet, that's more important. Understanding the code is important, since it allows you to build off it, and fix issues.</li>
    <li>COMMENTS! COMMENTS! COMMENTS! That's how YOU know what your code does, so you can tell other people.</li>
    <li>Aside from code knowledge: communication is a critical skill, wheter it's for grading, keeping a team running effeciently, or presenting something</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Consice and focused speaking, know what you're doing</li>
            <li>Effective communication is just as important as good coding skills</li>
            <li>Describing a process or workflow in an easy to understand way makes a coder much more valuable</li>
            <li>Flowcharts/visual aid helps communicate ideas better</li>
            <li>Agile methodology is useful for real-world situations, even if its not necessarily part of a class</li>
            <li>Git is useful for internships/multi-user applications, and development scenarios</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Scrum is a common (almost universally constant) mention from all of the people on the panel - universal communication, organization, and effeciency. Better get used to it.</li>
    <li>College Apps & College Tips</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Top colleges might not transfer APs in this field - making them less optimal, not entirely needed (Purdue Aeospace guy is benefitting greatly, and purdue's aerospace is top-tier anyways)</li>
            <li>Talking about projects is good for essays, but projects that connect to modern issues/topics of interest (suchas the facial recognition one from the girl, which touched on ethical concerns and personal concerns with AI) are extra good</li>
            <li>Making friends in college is GOOD! they can open many gateways into internships/jobs</li>
            <li>Show passion and try and show yourself on paper when writing to colleges</li>
            <li>In college, nobody cares about your GPA. Projects/technical skills matter much, much more</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Advice to do in HS:</li>
    <ul>
            <li>Do community college classes/classes for credits outside of school/Dual enrollment. Saves time, ups knowledge, helps get into college!</li>
            <li>Show passion and try and show yourself on paper when writing to colleges</li>
            <li>Extracurriculars -> more connections, whether it's just STEM or something CS related</li>
            <li>Only do clubs you care abt/passion</li>
            <li>Career fairs are good, allow for connections (HS or College)</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Note: This isnt optional - learning these skills will be critical to future success in CS</li>
<ul>
