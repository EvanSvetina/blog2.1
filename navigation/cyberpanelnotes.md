# New learned stuff (by panelist)
## David Tomasz - Intelligence analyst for the FBI. (GOVERNMENT)
1. Anti ransomware specialist.
2. Biggest threat is not something small(er) like ransomware - foreign data threat (ex china or other competitors) can bring down millions-billions of dollars in loss because of theft. AI is destroying most coding based jobs so lock the heck in (RUS CHI IRAN and N.KR are all getting rlly good)
3. CS does not have a crazy barrier to entry - once you're over the main hump it's a blast (allegedly)
4. IF not jumping into CS, have good people skills, organized, be a likeable person with good communication (HELPFUL IN ALL CAREERS)
5. Biggest challenge - thrown into CS pretty late, sharp learning curve and learning quick
6. GET A NETWORK _connect with valueable people so they can help you in turn. Be friends with good people who can help/know a lot/good at their jobs.
7. BAD TEAMMATES ARE A THING U GOTTA DEAL WITH (thanks ruhaan for the experience! jk ily pookie)
7. Cyber attacks that are technically possible/relatively easy to do can happen within hours
8. More technical/theoetical hacks never get off the ground (usually)
9. To stay up to date, go to conferences and READ THE NEWS!!!!
## Tricia Mercer - CPO at INDUS and board member on directory board for San Diego Cyber Excellence. (INDUSTRY)
1. Dealt with employee who was on a leave of absence, shut off access after they "left"" and accidentally stopped a data leak from disgruntled employee who was shipping data to rivals.
2. Phishing and scams easily prey on a large percentage of the workforce fall for traps and lose data
3. Biggest insipration: COMPUTERS ARE THE FUTURE :D ("The Cuckoo's Egg" book)
4. GOOD NEXT STEPS: background in IT is very helpful, know the essentials, build your own network
5. Biggest challenge - Learning good pitch skills and people skills are helpful - DUMB IT DOWN, less technical terms
6. Good tip - stay in the know and keep your eyes peeled, always pay attentions this stuff is constantly evolving
## Victor Nzeata - Founder and CEO of Cyber Brains Academy, adjunct prof. at USD. Guarding personal info and security for group (ACADEMIA)
1. Ai becoming dangerous at a cyber weapon standpoint, making ransomware and similar attacks easier to access, ethical hacking becoming more valuable
#### ZERO-DAY - a vulnurability in a system which cannot be patched (like a malisiouc update to microsoft that spreads to all pcs and can't easily be fixed.)
2. Benefit of ethical hackers - like a home security test. send a fake burglar in and fix the stuff they break in through (think vaccines)
#### Backdoor - easy way to get into a system (hidden usually)
3. Biggest Inspiration: Military/Cyber crossover, passion for coding
4. GOOD NEXT STEPS: get a background in IT
5. Biggest challenge - putting together a competent team and organizing, finding people who can help percive human impact (past technical stuff CS is full of, specializiation)
6. As a student, experience with linux tools will be helpful
7. CC certification from ICU (basic cybersecurity info): [Link](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cc)
# Personal Takeaways
1. CS HAS TO BE A PASSION (if you're gonna do cyber), so either run with it or stop
2. Uses in physics likely don't full apply to everything so I don't need to be the best in the world
3. gamedev needs networking and stuff
