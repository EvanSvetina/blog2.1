Open Coding Society: A Vision for Modern Education
1. Microcredentials (and TBD Blockchain Integration)
Concept:
Transform traditional points and grades into a modern credentialing system.
		Certificates represent foundational skills (fungible, standardized, and repeatable).
		Tokens (ie NFTs) represent unique achievements (non-fungible, personalized, and creative).
Execution:
		Certificate Design: Awarded for completing specific courses or modules (e.g., TLC, CSSE, CSP, CSA).
		NFT Design: Awarded for unique personal or collaborative projects (e.g., HyFlex contributions beyond provided instruction).
		Blockchain Storage (TBD): Credentials (both certificates and NFTs) are securely stored on the blockchain for verification and long-term ownership.
		Student Portfolios: Students use their certificates and NFTs to build a digital portfolio, enhancing their employability and college applications.
Examples of Credentials:
Certificates (Foundation):
		Foundation: Tools Basics Certificate, GitHub Pages Certificate
		CSSE: JavaScript Essentials Certificate, 2D Game Development Certificate
		CSP: Data Analysis with Python Certificate, Deployment - Linux/Cyber concepts Certificate
		CSA: Agile Toolkit Certificate, Blockchain Programming Certificate
NFTs (Unique):
		Foundation: Personalized Website NFT (unique design and implementation of GitHub Pages)
		CSSE: Custom 2D Game NFT (game mechanics and storyline by the student)
		CSP: Innovative Cybersecurity Tool NFT (unique security application or script)
		CSA: Advanced Blockchain App NFT (custom blockchain project using Python or Java)
2. HyFlex Learning Model
Concept:
Integrate multiple disciplines and projects into a single, adaptive framework that empowers students to learn foundational skills while contributing unique perspectives to shared goals.
Execution:
		Collaborative Projects:
		Hall Pass Project: Digital hall pass system integrating web development and database management.
		Agile Toolkit: Tools for Agile methodology in project management.
		Calendar Integration: Collaborative calendar with front-end and backend synchronization.
		Gamify-FinTech: A 2D game exploring financial concepts like banking, cryptocurrency, and stock trading.
		PilotCity Projects: Real-world internships and projects offering industry collaboration.
		Flexible Roles:
		 Students choose their Scrum role
         Students choose project(s) based on interest and expertise, contributing unique value to the team.
		Skill Alignment:
		 Certificates ensure foundational skill mastery
         NFTs represent the studentâ€™s distinctive impact on the project.
Benefits of this Model
Student Ownership: Credentials are student-owned, verifiable, and transportable.
Differentiated Achievements: Certificates build the foundation; NFTs highlight individuality.
Real-World Preparation: Credentials and HyFlex projects simulate modern workplace environments.
Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: HyFlex enables students to tackle diverse challenges and broaden their skills.
